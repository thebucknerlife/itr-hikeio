#Hikeio

This is the example Rails app we built together during GA's Intro to Ruby on OCtober 20, 2015.

Hikeio is an app for logging the hikes you've done.

This app includes:

* *Hike* A model with name, distance_mi, elevation_gain, and max_elevation
* *HikesController* with `home`, `create` and `index` actions
* *Views* for those actions
* *Routes* for those actions

##Getting Started

If you want to run this code locally (on a Mac), follow these steps:

1. Download the app
2. In Terminal, `cd` to the location of the folder.
3. Inside the `hikeio` folder, run `$ bundle install`
4. After that, run `$ rails server`
5. Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

Enjoy!
